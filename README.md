I have implemented the collaborative filtering learning algorithm and applied it to a dataset of movie ratings*. This dataset consists of ratings on a scale of 1 to 5. The dataset has  users, and  movies. I haveimplemented the function cofiCostFunc.m that computes the collaborative fitlering objective function and gradient. After implementing the cost function and gradient, I have used fmincg.m to learn the parameters for collaborative filtering.
